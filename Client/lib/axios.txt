Axios is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests to interact with web servers, APIs, or backend services. It works in both client-side (browser) and server-side (Node.js) environments and simplifies the process of sending asynchronous requests and handling responses.

Key Features of Axios

Promise-based API:

Axios is built on JavaScript promises, making it easy to work with asynchronous code using .then() or async/await.

Supports All HTTP Methods:

You can send requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.

Automatic JSON Data Handling:

Axios automatically converts JavaScript objects to JSON when sending requests and parses JSON responses into JavaScript objects.

Interceptors:
It provides interceptors to preprocess requests or responses (e.g., adding headers like authentication tokens or handling errors globally).

Base URLs and Custom Configurations:

You can set a base URL for your API endpoints and customize headers or parameters for all requests.

Cross-Browser Support:

Axios works across modern browsers and handles compatibility issues like older browsers' inability to support the native fetch API.

Cancellation Support:

You can cancel ongoing requests using tokens.

Timeouts:

Axios allows you to set a timeout for requests to avoid hanging on slow network connections.
